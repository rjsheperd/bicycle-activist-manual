Lori Woodard's was the first traffic death memorial I ever attended back in 2019. It was the first memorial I had organized. It was the first time I was writing to city staff and commissioners about how they needed take specific actions in the wake of her death.


What wasn't a first was there had been 15 other people killed as a result of traffic violence so far in Portland in 2019, an increase of 33% since the same time the previous year. Eight of those killed were people walking and one person was riding a bike.

Lori's death was the 16th. The police report stated that a delivery truck took a left turn into Lori at the corner of NE Broadway and Grand. Both of these one-way roads has three lanes of traffic, one of which was State-owned highway. There were documented incidents of other people walking across NE Broadway who had been struck in the exact same crossing, despite the fact that they were in a marked crossing at a traffic signal and had been given the "WALK" signal. While there are many factors to a deadly crash, it was clear that the design of intersection clearly played a role. A delivery truck took a left turn into her at the corner of NE Broadway and Grand, two one-way roads with three lanes apiece, one of which a former State-owned highway.

A few of us from [Bike Loud PDX](https://www.bikeloudpdx.org) had found a way to meet with one of the "good ones" within the city transportation bureau. They shared that, yes there were in fact changes that could be made to the intersection much less deadly to people walking. The outside-most lane could be closed to encourage much slower speeds, people walking could be given a "head start" into the intersection ahead of turning traffic, and speeds could be lowered to reduce the likelihood someone would be killed when struck by a vehicle.

With a plan for the changes we wanted to see, we reached out to Lori's family to ask if we could host a memorial in her honor and to asked if we pressure the city to make certain changes to the intersection. While the family was in another state, they gave us permission.

With that, we posted an event with a simple request: bring flowers, and wear Lori's favorite color blue. We sent out invites to our community members and partner organizations, along with the transportation Commissioner, Chloe Eudaly, and the higher-ups within the city's transportation bureau. We sent out press releases to the dailies, the newspaper of record, and all of the local TV and radio stations.

The day of the memorial, over 50 people huddled on the corner where Lori stood before she took her last few steps. Our partner organizations shared why it was so important that the city take decisive steps to curb traffic violence. Attendees made a procession through the crossing that Lori had been killed in.

When the Commissioner got up to speak, she shared her personal tragedy of losing her father to a preventable traffic crash when she was in her teens. Her office and bureau outlined the changes that they would be making: giving people walking a head-start, closing one of the lanes on NE Broadway for half a block, and looking at lowering speeds along the corridor. What was almost two weeks of work had paid off, and the changes were on the ground within two weeks.

While this particular intersection has been made slightly safer, we know there is much more work to be done across our city. This book is meant to give advocates some key tools in their tool belt to be successful in seeing changes in their community, specifically with the focus on reducing traffic violence.
