# Power Map

Using power maps is a great way for advocates to learn and understand connections between people, places, and opportunities. This will set advocates up for to understand who you can form a coalition with, as well as any major opposition that you will need to head off.

## Purpose

The purpose of Power Mapping is to understand the power relationships between elected officials, government agencies, organizations, unions, businesses, and their respective levels of support or opposition to policies you are attempting to push forward.

### Getting Started

1. Download and print copies of the [power map worksheet](/downloads/power-map.pdf).
1. Gather these tools:
- Sticky notes
- Pens
- Large wall or white-board
1. Block out about an hour to complete.
1. While this can be done as a solo exercise, it is encouraged to done with your whole team.

### Brainstorming

To start, distribute the large packet of sticky notes and ask folks to start writing down the organizations, people, employers, and businesses in your neighborhood / geographic area that can influence the key decision-makers. These might be the local shop owners on a commercial street who may not want to see parking removed, or possibly employers in the area who would like to see more investment in Low-Carbon forms of transportation.

### Sorting

Once you have developed that large list, start to sort them onto two axes: "How likely are they to support or oppose the policy?", and "How much influence do they have on our key decision-maker" (see image)? It will be best at this point to have a particular decision-maker in mind, be it a Bureau director, council-member, a state representative, or even your congressional members.

### Political Contributions

In some cases, it is best to look at political donations in order to find out who really has influence over a particular decision-maker. Here are useful websites that can be used to find out political donations:

- [OpenSecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org)

### Coalition-Building

Once you have found those entities that are strongly opposed, neutral, and strong supporters, along with their respective level of influence, you can use this information to see who you can form a coalition with to ensure your success in getting the policy adopted. If you happen to have enough influence over a decision-maker, this exercise is helpful to identify what to prepare in case your opposition mounts a campaign against you.
