When someone asks, "What can I do to get involved in bicycling activism?" my first response is always "Ride your bike." Riding a bicycle is also a daily form of protest and activism, in and of itself. The simple act of choosing to ride a bicycle to your school, library, or work is key to activism. Riding on a daily or weekly basis normalizes bicycling as a transportation method to your friends, colleagues, and even the neighbors who happen to see you as they sit in traffic. It takes tremendous courage to occupy the space that has been taken from people to be made the exclusive right of the automobile<sup>[1](#citations)</sup>. The feeling that you get from riding a bicycle to school, shopping, and for other errands is both living your values than slapping a "Save the Planet" sticker on your car.

If you already ride your bicycle around your city, take a few moments to answer these questions before moving onto the next chapters:
1. Why do I ride a bicycle?
1. How often do I ride a bicycle? How often would I like to ride my bike?
1. Where do I ride my bike to? Where would I like to ride my bike to, but remains too dangerous to ride to?

## Combatting Isolation

Today we live in an increasingly isolated society. Most Americans live in communities that are designed around the automobile, a technology that is not only expensive to own and maintain, but also one which requires being a certain age, the ability to see, and the physical/cognitive ability as well. For children, and increasingly mentally and physically impaired seniors, that has meant living in places that can feel more like prisons rather than a community.

It should also be noted that our society is increasingly addicted to smartphones (a slot machine in your pocket), video-games, and social media (a way of forming lose connections, but lacking in forming deep emotional bonds). This is especially true with teens and young adults, sometimes to referred to as "Gen-I", which grew up with smartphones and social media from when they were young. Unfortunately, the rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide have sky-rocketed among teens and young adults, with 50% more teens reporting signs of major depression from 2011 to 2015, and the suicide rate for teens has double since 2007<sup>[2](#citations)</sup>.

With the onset of a global pandemic, the many social activities were made off-limits to help reduce the spread of the virus. That has meant many turning to social media and online devices to supplement the in-person contact that humans are meant to have. Bicycling remains an incredibly safe activity, in spite of the pandemic, as it is outdoors with very little risk of transmission.

Take a few moments ask yourself:
1. How much time do I spend on social media? How much time do I spend on my smartphone?
1. How much time do I spend outside? How much time do I spend socializing offline?
1. Who are some of my closest friends? When was the last time I spent considerable time talking to them over the phone or in-person?

## Riding with the Pack

Riding a bicycle may not be seen as an inherently social activity. The image some have of riding a bike may be the Middle-Aged Men In Lycra (MAMIL) with their carbon fiber frames worth thousands of dollars riding hundreds of miles. However, riding a bike is actually the 2nd most popular recreational activity in the US. It remains an incredibly accessible activity, one which children are capable of doing as early as age 2, and older adults can do well beyond when it is considered unsafe for them to get behind a wheel. Now that adaptive bicycles and Electric-Assist pedal bikes are becoming cheaper and more common, those who have bad knees or limited physical mobility are increasingly turning toward bicycles as not only a form of recreation, but also transportation.

You may have heard of the largest world-wide summer bicycle festival, [Pedalpalooza](https://bikeportland.org/2021/08/17/pedalpalooza-through-the-lens-of-photographer-amit-zinman-336765), which sees riders on bikes of all ages, abilities, shapes and sizes. Themes often accompany each ride, including the Star Trek Ride, the Orange ride, the Talking Heads ride, and the Loud & Lit Ride. Some rides happen weekly, such as group rides to the Farmer's Market. With many rides being no-drop rides with the group rolling at a deliberate "party pace", the rides become a social event on wheels. Most of these rides occur on residential streets, but when the group is large enough it might "take the lane" on commercial corridors.

Group rides are not only a big inspiration and source of joy for those on the ride, but can also inspire those who are around you. Seeing a large group of people riding bikes through a neighborhood often elicits lots of waving, cheering, and possibly even getting a hosed down on a particularly hot summer day.

Finally, group rides are a great way to see what changes need to be made to improve the infrastructure in your community. Inviting staff from the Transportation agencies, and even elected officials helps raise awareness of the needs in your neighborhood.

Here are a few more questions for you:
1. What theme idea do you have for a group ride?
1. Who else could help you organize that group ride in your neighborhood? What kind of low-stress route could you ride at a "party pace"?
1. How could you support local businesses with your ride? Would they help sponsor the ride?

## Prosperity for your City

Additionally, the act of riding helps you learn what infrastructure needs to be improved. Your city planners and engineers don't have the on-the-ground experience that you will from riding in your neighborhood or across town. This invaluable knowledge is what is necessary to creating a safer, more accessible bicycling experience for those who otherwise would never set their foot on a pedal.
