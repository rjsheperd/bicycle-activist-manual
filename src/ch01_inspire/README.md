When someone asks, "What can I do to get involved in bicycling activism?" my first response is always "Ride your bike." Riding a bicycle is not only a daily form of exercise, it is also a daily form of protest and activism, in and of itself.

The simple act of choosing to ride a bicycle to your school, library, or work is key to activism. Riding on a daily or weekly basis normalizes bicycling as a transportation method to your friends, colleagues, and even the neighbors who happen to see you as they sit in traffic. It takes tremendous courage to occupy the space that has been taken from people to be made the exclusive right of the automobile[^1]. Riding a bicycle to school, shopping, and for other errands will not only [improve your heath](#health), significantly [increase your prosperity](#wealth) by reducing your transportation costs, strengthen your [connection to your community](#combatting-lonelines), and reduce your impact on the environment -- it's a signal to others that they too can [join the fun.](#riding-with-the-pack)

If you already ride your bicycle around your city, take a few moments to answer these questions before moving onto the next chapters:
1. Why do I ride a bicycle?
1. How often do I ride a bicycle? How often would I like to ride my bike?
1. Where do I ride my bike to? Where would I like to ride my bike to, but remains too dangerous to ride to?

## Health

Human bodies were never meant to be sedentary. With our upright bipedal form, humans were never meant to sit in a car, then at a desk, then on the sofa for upwards of 12 hours a day. We know from many studies that physical activity is shown to reduce the risk chronic illnesses, including diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. Not only that, but physical activity also reduces the onset of anxiety and depression<sup>[2](#citations)</sup>.

Bicycling as a form of transportation allows physical activity to be a part of your daily life. Rather than having to drive to a gym or park, you can simply take your bike to get your daily groceries or run a quick errand. Keep in mind, it only takes 15 minutes to ride a bike 3 miles, which is the same distance that covers nearly half of all automobile trips in the US<sup>[3](#citations)</sup>.

While some may say that riding a bicycle is dangerous, it is far more dangerous for your health to be in a vehicle. According to the CDC, motor vehicle crashes are also the leading cause of death among children and adults under the age of 44, and the third leading cause of death behind heart disease and stroke for people over 45 <sup>[2](#citations)</sup>. While it may be perceived as unsafe to bike, crashes are unlikely to be deadly as speeds are often much lower than a vehicle. The major cause of death when riding a bike are vehicles (Later, we will discuss how to minimize deaths and serious injuries from crashes involving vehicles).

Thin about:
1. What kinds of physical activities did you do this past week?
1. What are some ways you incorporate physical activity into your everyday routine?
1. What are some of the ways that riding your bicycle for transportation could impact your health? Has it already impacted your health? How?

## Wealth

The cost of traveling in the United States is some of the highest in the world due to the dependence on automobiles. A typical American spends over $10,000 per year on a vehicle, including car loans, registration, fuel, insurance, and maintenance <sup>[3](#citations)</sup>. On the other hand, a bicycle is astoundingly inexpensive compared to other forms of travel. Even the purchase of a new Electric-assist bike only costs a few thousand dollars, compared to tens of thousands of dollars for a new vehicle. Registration and insurance for Electric Bikes are zero, and "fuel" in electricity typically costs less than $5/year in most of the United States. Riding a bicycle also means you can skip the gym membership, and likely reduce costly doctor's visits by increasing your physical activity.

Spend a moment to answer the following:
1. How much have you paid for your vehicle over the past year? (Be sure to include car payments, maintenance, gas, insurance, and registration fees.)
1. How much have you paid to own and operate your bicycle over it's entire lifetime?
1. What could you do with the savings from riding your bicycle more? What would you do with the savings if you could get rid of a vehicle?

## Global Impact

Not only will biking more help you improve your mental and physical health, all while saving money on transportation costs, it also gives you a chance to make an impact toward some of the big issues facing humanity. Whether it's preserving a habitable planet by taking action on Climate Change, or taking a stand against oil-fueled dictatorships which deny people of their basic human rights. The challenges of the world can feel insurmountable at times, but it is important to remember that we can each play a small part in overcoming those obstacles.

Take time to reflect:
1. What sort of impact on the world do you want to see? How can bicycling help achieve that outcome?

## Combatting Loneliness

Today we live in an increasingly isolated society. Most Americans live in communities that are designed around the automobile -- a technology that is not only expensive to own and maintain, but also one which requires being a certain age, the ability to see, and the physical/cognitive ability as well. For a third of our society -- including children, older seniors, and those with limited physically mobility -- are living in places that can feel more like prisons rather than a community.

It should also be noted that our society is increasingly addicted to smartphones (a slot machine in your pocket), video-games, and social media (a way of forming lose connections, but lacking in forming deep emotional bonds). This is especially true with teens and young adults, sometimes to referred to as "Gen-I", which grew up with smartphones and social media from when they were young. Unfortunately, the rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide have sky-rocketed among teens and young adults, with 50% more teens reporting signs of major depression from 2011 to 2015, and the suicide rate for teens has double since 2007<sup>[4](#citations)</sup>.

With the onset of a global pandemic, the many social activities were made off-limits to help reduce transmission, which has caused social media and online devices to further supplement the in-person contact that humans are meant to have. Bicycling remains an incredibly safe activity, in spite of the pandemic, as it is outdoors with very little risk of transmission.

Take a few moments ask yourself:
1. How much time do I spend on social media? How much time do I spend on my smartphone?
1. How much time do I spend outside? How much time do I spend socializing offline?
1. Who are some of my closest friends? When was the last time I spent considerable time talking to them over the phone or in-person?

## Riding with the Pack

Riding a bicycle may not be seen as an inherently social activity. The image some have of riding a bike may be the Middle-Aged Men In Lycra (MAMIL) with their carbon fiber frames worth thousands of dollars riding hundreds of miles. However, riding a bike is actually the 2nd most popular recreational activity in the US. It remains an incredibly accessible activity where in which children as young as two years old are capable of bicycling, and older adults can do well beyond when it is considered unsafe for them to get behind the wheel of a car. Now that adaptive bicycles and Electric-Assist pedal bikes are becoming cheaper and more common, those who have bad knees or limited physical mobility are increasingly turning toward bicycles as not only a form of recreation, but also transportation.

You may have heard of the largest world-wide summer bicycle festival, [Pedalpalooza](https://bikeportland.org/2021/08/17/pedalpalooza-through-the-lens-of-photographer-amit-zinman-336765), which sees riders on bikes of all ages, abilities, shapes and sizes. Themes often accompany each ride, including the Star Trek Ride, the Orange ride, the Talking Heads ride, and the Loud & Lit Ride. Some rides happen weekly, such as group rides to the Farmer's Market. With many rides being no-drop rides with the group rolling at a deliberate "party pace", the rides become a social event on wheels. Most of these rides occur on residential streets, but when the group is large enough it might "take the lane" on commercial corridors.

Group rides are not only a big inspiration and source of joy for those on the ride, but can also inspire those who are around you. Seeing a large group of people riding bikes through a neighborhood often elicits lots of waving, cheering, and possibly even getting a hosed down on a particularly hot summer day.

Here are a few more questions for you:
1. What theme idea do you have for a group ride?
1. Who else could help you organize that group ride in your neighborhood? What kind of low-stress route could you ride at a "party pace"?
1. How could you support local businesses with your ride? Would they help sponsor the ride?

## Prosperity for your City

Finally, the act of riding helps you learn what infrastructure needs to be improved. Your city planners and engineers won't have the on-the-ground experience that you will from riding in your neighborhood or across town. This invaluable knowledge is necessary to ensuring your city creates a safer, more accessible bicycling experience for those who otherwise would never set their foot on a pedal.

Consider inviting staff from your city's public works or transportation agency, along with elected officials on a group ride around your community to raise awareness of the needs in your neighborhood.

Let's take a moment to answer the following:
1. Where in my community are there opportunities to make bicycling safer?
1. Which people and organizations in my community want to see bicycling made safer?


## Next Steps

Now that you're inspired to help make bicycling a safer, more accessible, and more joyful, let's get to how to [what to measure in a bicycling network](/ch02_measure/).
