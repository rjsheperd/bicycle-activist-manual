When someone asks, "What can I do to get involved in bicycling activism?" my first response is always "Ride your bike." Riding a bicycle is also a daily form of protest and activism, in and of itself. The simple act of choosing to ride a bicycle to your school, library, or work is key to activism. Riding on a daily or weekly basis normalizes bicycling as a transportation method to your friends, colleagues, and even the neighbors who happen to see you as they sit in traffic. It takes tremendous courage to occupy the space that has been taken from people to be made the exclusive right of the automobile[1]. The feeling that you get from riding a bicycle to school, shopping, and for other errands is both living your values than slapping a "Save the Planet" sticker on your car.

If you already ride your bicycle around your city, take a few moments to answer these questions before moving onto the next chapters:
1. Why do I ride a bicycle?
1. How often do I ride a bicycle? How often would I like to ride my bike?
1. Where do I ride my bike to? Where would I like to ride my bike to, but remains too dangerous to ride to?

## Fun

Today we live in an increasingly isolated society. Most Americans live in suburban communities that are designed around the automobile, a technology that is not only expensive to own and maintain, but also one which requires spatial awareness, the ability to see, physical ability, and strong mental cognition. For children, and increasingly mentally and physically impaired seniors, that has meant living in places that can feel more like prisons rather than a community.

## Prosperity for your City

Additionally, the act of riding helps you learn what infrastructure needs to be improved. Your city planners and engineers don't have the on-the-ground experience that you will from riding in your neighborhood or across town. This invaluable knowledge is what is necessary to creating a safer, more accessible bicycling experience for those who otherwise would never set their foot on a pedal.
